OMP version:
  -WHy does valgrind say that I have not freed memory, but in pthread version everything is freed???
  - Is there a way that I dont need to create and close a parallel region for every iterations in ITERATIONS loop?
  - can i just do ceil chunk? Does this cause some overlapping in iterations between threads? or is this just max amount of work it will be distributed?


PTH version:
  - Is there a better way to implement switching petris in between iterations than the double barrier I have used?
  - Is using gnu99 instead of stdc99 ok in order to get to use pthread_barrier_t??
  - when making, some warning about different size when casting
  - IS it ok do dump all axtra work to last last thread when img size is not wholy divided nby number of processors? I mean its almost no percentage difference

What is the fuzz about the rand function??? There is no rand function in CA.c

In the handout code, it is forgotten to free the buffers in the make_bmp functions, I have fixed this myself in the functions

Reading intergers from command line argument in both versions


iterations are done from row 1 and row size -3. Is it ok to do this for the rest aswell? meaning 2 white lines at bot, 1 white line/col other edges?
